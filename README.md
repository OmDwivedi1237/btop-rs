# **rtop: A Terminal System Monitor Written in Rust**

`rtop` is a blazing-fast, terminal-based system monitor built with Rust. It provides real-time insights into your system's performance, including CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, all displayed in a beautifully designed terminal UI. Inspired by `btop++`, `rtop` aims to be lightweight, fast, and highly extensible.

---

## **Features**

- **Real-Time Monitoring**:  
  Get instant updates for CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, refreshed every 250ms.

- **Intuitive Terminal UI**:  
  Built with [`ratatui`](https://github.com/tui-rs-revival/ratatui), the UI is clean, responsive, and customizable.

- **Graphical Representation**:  
  Displays CPU usage as a graph for visual tracking over time.

- **Extensibility**:  
  Includes a plugin system to allow custom monitoring modules to be added.

- **Lightweight and Fast**:  
  Written entirely in Rust for performance and minimal system overhead.

## **Extending `rtop`**

### **Adding Plugins**

You can create plugins to extend the functionality of `rtop`. Plugins should follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new module in the `plugins/` directory.
2. Implement the desired functionality, ensuring compatibility with the existing UI.
3. Register the plugin in `plugins/mod.rs`.

A sample plugin is provided in `plugins/example.rs`.
